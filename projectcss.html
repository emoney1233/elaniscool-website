  <h1>THE GOAL:</h1>
  <p>Conserve and sustainably use the oceans, seas and marine resources for sustainable development</p>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <h1>INTRO:</h1>
  <p2>Oceans, seas and coastal areas are a essential component of the Earth’s ecosystem and it's sustainable development. They cover more than two-thirds of the earth’s surface and contain 97% of the planet’s water. Oceans contribute to creating sustainable livelihoods and almost three billion people depend on marine and coastal resources. In addition, oceans are crucial for global food security and human health. They are also the primary regulator of the global climate and they provide us with water and the oxygen we breathe. Finally, oceans host as huge biomes for biodiversity. The benefits provided by oceans, seas and marine resources are important to all people, the poor, indigenous peoples, and vulnerable groups with a high dependency on natural resources and ecosystem services may have their well-being especially tied to these benefits. The link between oceans, seas and marine resources and human well-being is not one-sided.</p2>
